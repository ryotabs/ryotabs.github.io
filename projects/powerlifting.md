summary: Escaped skinny-kid-land and learned a few things along the way

I started my lifting journey a few years ago when I finally decided that I was tired of always being called the skinny kid. I remember my humble beginnings at the 24 Hour Fitness in Maui, barely being able to bench press the bar. Now that I look back at it, I've come a far way! Honestly, lifting has probably taught me more and allowed me to learn a lot about myself more than any other thing that I've experienced, especially at an early point of my life (maybe my african adventure comes to a close second, you can read about it [here](https://ryotabs.github.io/projects/fun-in-the-sun)). I am fortunate enough to also have the opportunity to participate in the UH Manoa Powerlifting Club as well, to be with like minded individuals and to push each other to be our very best. 

Throughout my journey, I've learned a lot of things about lifting weights and fitness. The most important one to me, is that going to the gym and lifting weights are only a small part of establishing healthy lifestyle habits. In order to have a healthy lifestyle, one must adjust other aspects of their life as well to see results. I didn't realize this at first, and thought that just going to the gym would be sufficient enough to call myself healthy. I was completely wrong, and now realize that establishing healthy lifestyle habits also includes eating the right foods, getting enough sleep, and managing stress effectively, to name a few. Once I started incorporating those changes into my life, things started improving, and I started feeling a lot better and stronger. 

Another big thing that I've learned throughout my step into fitness and health is that consistency is key. Hey that sounds familiar to the strategy for surviving in ICS314! Being consistent allows me to establish a routine that I can follow, and gives me a little discipline that I can, and have applied to other aspects of my life. It allows me to establish routines when I get ready for school, and when I come home for the day. It also always gets me off my ass whenever I feel like a hint of laziness is approaching, but it doesn't work all the time, and is definitely something that still needs to be worked on. 

The effectiveness of establishing a plan before you attack something is also something that I learned along my weight-lifting journey. In the fitness community (or at least in the /r/fitness subreddit), there's something called f***around-itis, which describes the phenomenon of not having a set plan in place at the gym, and doing whatever for the sake of doing it, without a plan. This might seem like it's working out in the beginning, but will quickly prove to be an ineffective strategy as time goes on. The same can be applied to Software Engineering, and life in general. A plan must be established in order to succeed, and establishing my plan and set routine in the gym helped me realize that at an early age. 

Starting the path of iron has done nothing but improve my life in all aspects, and is still an on-going endeavor. I hope to achieve my goals soon, and continue implementing healthy lifestyle choices to my life to live a long and healthy life.
