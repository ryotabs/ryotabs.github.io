In November of last year, I was deployed to Africa with the Hawaii Air National Guard to support operations that were going in within the area. A majority of my duties included providing help desk support to our numerous customers that reached out to us, but I was able to get my hands dirty with other things like System Administration, Networking, and Radio Frequency Transmission. Throughout my time in Africa, I participated in numerous projects, led a few initiatives, and managed/implemented new systems to improve our communications capability throughout the entire base. The timing of the deployment did not work out with my school schedule, so I had to unfortunately withdraw from my classes during the Fall 2018 semester, which included ICS 314. However, I definitely learned a lot throughout the deployment, both about things IT related, and about myself and how I work with others in a team setting.
