Over the summer, I had the pleasure of installing Arch Linux on my Dell XPS 15. I do prefer macOS, as the unix-based OS seems ideal for my computer science courses, but didn't like the hardware of it, as my keyboards was having problems, and was the most atrocious thing to type on. Therefore, I got the best of both worlds and dual-booted my computer with Windows 10 and Arch Linux. 

Arch Linux has the reputation of being notoriously difficult to install for those that are not very familiar with Linux. The main reason, in my opinion, is because the entire installation is terminal based, until you get to the point where you are able to install a graphical environment. When you start the installation, you are greeted with a blank terminal screen, and are required to type terminal commands for the installation. Despite this, Arch Linux is one of the more popular Linux distributions that is used, even for those that are new to the world of Linux. One of the main appeals is that it is "bleeding edge", meaning that it "strives to maintain the latest stable release versions of its software" (from the Arch Linux wiki). This means that software packages are constantly getting updated as time goes on. Another reason is that it is a very simple system when it is installed, which means that the user is able to install the packages/software that they want, and know exactly what is on their system, to avoid unecessary bloatware that may come with other distributions (Ubuntu being a main culprit). These are the main reasons why Arch is my distribution of choice. 

After numerous failed install attempts, I was finally able to get it up and running with a window manager, custom configurations, and desired applications that I will be using for my classes. The Arch Linux Wiki was my primary resource in assisting with the install, and is considered to be the best documentation across the Linux distributions. I became very comfortable with basic terminal commands from the MORE MORE MORE
