 Over the summer, I had the pleasure of installing Arch Linux on my Dell XPS 15. I do prefer macOS, as the unix-based OS seems ideal for my computer science courses, but didn't like the hardware, as the components were underpowered for the steep price point, and the touch bar was probably the worst input experience that I've ever encountered. I also had problems with the keyboard, as it was continuously skipping letters, and was the most atrocious thing to type on. When [one of the keys on my keyboard died](https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/), I didn't waste any time to replace the faulty key, back up my files and settings, restore the computer to factory defaults, and sell it on Facebook Market for nearly as much as I paid for it when I got it a year earlier. Although I sold the computer, I didn't want to part with macOS, and I absolutely did not want to be stuck with Windows 10 as well. I wanted all the goodies of macOS (unix shell, terminal, clean and sleek UI) in a machine that also had good components at a reasonable price. This is where the XPS 15, and Linux come into the story.
 
 Arch Linux has the reputation of being notoriously difficult to install for those that are not very familiar with Linux. The main reason, in my opinion, is because the entire installation is terminal based, until you get to the point where you are able to install a graphical environment. When you start the installation, you are greeted with a blank terminal screen, and are required to type terminal commands for the installation. Despite this, Arch Linux is one of the more popular Linux distributions that is used, even for those that are new to the world of Linux. One of the main appeals is that it is "bleeding edge", meaning that it "strives to maintain the latest stable release versions of its software" (from the Arch Linux wiki). This means that software packages are constantly getting updated as time goes on. Another reason is that it is a very simple system when it is installed, which means that the user is able to install the packages/software that they want, and know exactly what is on their system to avoid unecessary bloatware that may come with other distributions (Ubuntu being a main culprit). These are the main reasons why Arch is my distribution of choice. 

 After numerous failed installation attempts, I was finally able to get it up and running with a window manager, custom configurations, and desired applications that I will be using for my classes. The Arch Linux Wiki was my primary resource in assisting with the installation, and is considered to be the best documentation across the Linux distributions. I became very comfortable with terminal commands, as I had to do various things like partitioning my hard drive, formatting the partitions, and downloading software, to name a few. I also worked with a lot of configuration files, and used a text editor called 'Vim'. Vim had such a steep learning curve, but once I learned it, I became much more productive editing my configuration files, and am also able to help my classmates with learning Vim, as we are currently using it in ICS212.
