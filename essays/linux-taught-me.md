Recently, one of our assignments was to read an essay called "How to ask questions the smart way". After reading the essay, I'd say the saying "help me help you" describes it in the most concise, elegant, and most efficient way possible. It establishes an entire process that one must go through before asking any question at all. The preliminary conditions that one must go through involve searching the web for any similar questions that were asked, and seeing if those would provide the desired solution. Combing through existing documentation, FAQs, experimenting for a solution, or even asking a friend are all things that one can do to see if they can find the answer to the question. Then, if and only if one cannot find the answer that they are looking for, then they can try to ask their question, with certain conditions. The person asking the questions must demonstrate that they have tried searching for a solution on their own, and also show that they are not just expecting the answer to just be given to them in plain sight. The objective is to get guidance from the community to point you in the right direction.

##Using your resources
Whenever we get stuck with our code, Stack Overflow is usually the first site that appears when we start searching the big wide world of the internet for help. The website is full of lots of questions from both aspiring young programmers, to seasoned industry veterans, all aiming to provide assistance, or to request assistance from their fellow eggheads. Although fellow members of the community are more than happy to help each other, utilizing the tips in the essay can ensure that someone may come around with the exact solution you are looking for. Including more information, and being as detailed as possible significantly increases those chances as well.

Here's an example of a pretty good question that was asked.
