## The burning question
Recently, one of our assignments was to read an essay called "How to ask questions the smart way". After reading the essay, I'd say the saying "help me help you" describes it in the most concise, elegant, and most efficient way possible. It establishes an entire process that one must go through before asking any question at all. The preliminary conditions that one must go through involve searching the web for any similar questions that were asked, and seeing if those would provide the desired solution. Combing through existing documentation, FAQs, experimenting for a solution, or even asking a friend are all things that one can do to see if they can find the answer to the question. Then, if and only if one cannot find the answer that they are looking for, then they can try to ask their question, with certain conditions. The person asking the questions must demonstrate that they have tried searching for a solution on their own, and also show that they are not just expecting the answer to just be given to them in plain sight. The objective is to get guidance from the community to point you in the right direction.
