To get an overall description of the experience, I also described this project [here](https://ryotabs.github.io/projects/arch). 

## The reasoning

For my first semester at UH Manoa, I bought a 13-inch 2017 Macbook Pro, decked out with the best processor and maximum amount of RAM that was available at the time. I used it for a year before one of my keys started to stop working. That was just the final straw that made me want to run far away from the direction that Apple was going with their computers. The keyboard was probably the biggest issue that I had with it, and I know that sounds like the most trivial thing to complain about, but the typing experience makes or breaks the overall experience. The keys had a short travel distance, making it feel like my fingers were just hammering onto a hard surface, and made my fingers and wrists ache after only 30 minutes of continuous typing. The keyboard was also extremely loud, which made doing homework and writing papers in the library or in a quiet room absolutely impossible, as I did not want to disturb anyone else around me. The typing experience was also important because typing is something that I will be doing a majority of the time, writing code, or technical essays, or sending messages over slack. However, the one thing that I did like was macOS. The overall experience was an absolute delight, the UI was sleek and minimalistic, and working with terminal was a breeze, as opposed to the frustrating experience with command line on Windows. Therefore, I wanted something that was somewhat close to the build quality of a Macbook, had better specs but was cheaper, and was able to handle dual booting windows and linux well. To my luck, I found a good deal on the newest model XPS 15, with the 8th generation Intel i7 processor, and paid less than I did for my Macbook Pro, which was nice as I sold the Macbook for almost as much as I bought it for. 

## The decision

I went with Arch Linux because I was attracted to the simplicity of it. It had a 'build your own system' vibe to it, and allows you to know exactly what is on your system to reduce overall clutter. I've used Ubuntu before, and there was just too much bloatware on it, like the native Amazon app that was included in 16.04. I have used elementaryOS, which was aesthetically simmilar to macOS, but application support for it wasn't the greatest. One of the best appeals of Arch Linux is the [Arch User  Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/). The AUR contains custom packages that are developed by users, and greatly expands the pool of available software to install. It was also a do-it-yourself system, meaning that the user is responsible for ensuring that the system is configured correctly, and is expected to tinker with the system to learn it. With this in mind, I downloaded the disk image for Arch linux, created a bootable USB, and booted to the USB to begin the installation.

## The process

I was greeted with a blank terminal screen, which was very intimidating.
