## Setting the stage

The semester starts off, and your classes seem easy enough. Two modules a week, with an assignment or two due almost every day, screencasts to watch, and readings to do. Seems easy enough, right? Oh wait, that's right, you also have to read a chapter or two a week from your algorithms textbook that pretty much looks like gibberish and can't understand it at all, watch a few more screencasts that go right over your head, make quizzes based on those screencasts that are completely useless to the learning experience but are still somehow part of the class, listen to a teacher that speaks in an almost cryptic like language so you have to pretty much learn the material for one of the hardest classes in the ICS curriculum by yourself, and do all your work for your other classes which may or may not consist of chemistry, calculus, physics, a second language, and an upper level writing intensive. But hey, still a piece of cake if all you're focusing on is school right? 

## The battle with time

As a student in the ICS program, the general consensus is that the curriculum is extremely time consuming. There are multiple assignments due throughout the week, and there is a load of material to learn. One thing to note in particular is the flipped pedagology of a few of these classes. Although they have their benefits, the format of these classes just require more time invested in them than other classes, and that's also assuming that we have an ideal case, where everything works perfectly the first time. Because that is never the case, we can also expect to spend an indefinte amount of time debugging programs/code, and looking for error messages. In addition to this, other obligations with life start to come up at all points within the process of learning the material. Things like a social life, a job, a significant other, other classes, exercise, extracurricular activities, household chores (cleaning, cooking your own meals, laundry, etc) and sleep are all things that need a good amount of time, and could get in the way of succeeding in one's education. 

## Everything in moderation
