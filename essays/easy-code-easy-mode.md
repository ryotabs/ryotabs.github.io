## Standards are a thing?
When I decided to step into the world of computer science, standards were one of the things that honestly has not passed my mind at all. It seemed like coding standards did not exist, as programming seemed like such an expressive activity, in the sense that there were multiple ways to solve a problem. I thought that the extent of having readable and maintanable code was to have correct spacing, and not write an entire program on one line. Other than that, as long as the problem or issue gets solved, then there's nothing to worry about, right? After all, all people care about is the end product, as long as there's a product released to the customer, the company gets their money, and everyone's happy. Except for the software engineers/developers that have to fix the inevitable bugs and errors that start to appear down the line because no set coding standard was implemented. 

## The right way is not always the easiest
Initially, getting used to the coding standards was a rough road. After following the [guide](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f18/morea/coding-standards/experience-install-eslint.html) on how to get one's development enviroment set up with ESLint, (which is the coding standard tool that we are using for our class), code that I wrote like normal up until this very point got torn to shreds by ESLint. There were errors (represented by an ugly red squiggly, our development environment really makes it easy for you to know when you've screwed up) as far as the eye can see, which meant that the code that I've written so far was unsatisfactory by the new standards that were imposed on us by ESLint. Initially, it was a matter of guessing and checking, moving things around and adjusting spacing and formatting to see if I could mitigate any kind of errors that popped up, which wasn't really the most effective method. Once I realized this, I tried a different approach. At the end of each error message, there was some kind of reference that I could reference via Google to see exactly what the error was, and what caused it specifically. The process is eventually rinsed and repeated, until you get the fabled green checkmark (that shows that your code adheres to the standards) in the upper right hand corner of your editor. At first, I expected a world of pain, as this little green checkmark was going to send me in a downward spiral toward insanity, but with many things in this class, I realized that I needed to learn to embrace and even love the process. After the tedious process of correcting each and every little ESLint error, the green checkmark was a sight of relief. Although my learning process of ESLint was significantly slow, I felt like reading and learning about each of the errors that I have made has improved the way that I write my code in a significant way. Reading about the errors in detail, and seeing the correct code style has cut down on the time that I have spent fixing my errors. This is because I can learn to write code that does not trigger trivial ESLint errors, and will allow me to focus on debugging bigger errors in my programs. Although the learning curve was steep at first, it has made me much more efficient and effective student, and hopefully in the future, a more effective software engineer.

## K.I.S.S (Keep It Simply Semantic)
Having standardized code can provide a lot of benefits, at least from my viewpoint, as someone that does not have any exposure to the industry at all. In my opinion, having standardized code simplifies the process of fixing errors and debugging, as there is a standardized set of rules and guidelines that one's code must adhere to. ESLint provides an error message that shows examples of incorrect, and correct code with a quick google search of the error message. Because the code is standardized, it is much easier to read and dissect with those that are familiar with the standards. Having code that is easier to read makes it easier to understand, and allow more time to be spent on fixing semantic errors (errors that affect the output of the program, and are not the intended output of the program) insetad of syntax errors in one's code. This reduces the time spent fixing trivial errors, and thus saves money for the company as less time and resources are allocated to troubleshooting the program.

## Thinking big picture
Learning coding standards feels like swimming upstream, but it's a necessary topic to touch up on and have experience with, and I'm really greatful to learn about the importance of coding standards before I embark on my (hopeful) journey to become a proficient and competent software engineer. Like everything else in this class, I hope to learn things that will allow me to become a valuble contributor to numerous projects.
