## Standards are a thing?
When I decided to step into the world of computer science, standards were one of the things that honestly has not passed my mind at all. It seemed like coding standards did not exist, as programming seemed like such an expressive activity, in the sense that there were multiple ways to solve a problem. As long as the problem or issue gets solved, then there's nothing to worry about, right? After all, all people care about is the end product, as long as there's a product released to the customer, the company gets their money, and everyone's happy. Except for the developers. 

## The right way is not always the easiest
Initially, getting used to the coding standards was a rough road. After following the [guide](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f18/morea/coding-standards/experience-install-eslint.html) on how to get one's development enviroment set up with ESLint, (which is the coding standard tool that we are using for our class), code that I wrote like normal up until this very point got torn to shreds by ESLint. There were errors (represented by an ugly red squiggly, our development environment really makes it easy for you to know when you've screwed up) as far as the eye can see, which meant that the code that I've written so far was unsatisfactory by the new standards that were imposed on us by ESLint. Initially, it was a matter of guessing and checking, moving things around and adjusting spacing and formatting to see if I could mitigate any kind of errors that popped up, which wasn't really the most effective method. Once I realized this, I tried a different approach. At the end of each error message, there was some kind of reference that I could reference via Google to see exactly what the error was, and what caused it specifically. Although my learning process of ESLint was significantly slow, I felt like reading and learning about each of the errors that I have made has improved the way that I write my code in a significant way. Reading about the errors in detail, and seeing the correct code style has cut down on the time that I have spent fixing my errors. This is because I can learn to write code that does not trigger trivial ESLint errors, and will allow me to focus on debugging bigger errors in my programs. Although the learning curve was steep at first, it has made me much more efficient and effective student.
