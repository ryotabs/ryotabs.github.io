## Time is key

As a student in the ICS program, the general consensus is that the curriculum is extremely time consuming. There are multiple assignments due throughout the week, and there is a load of material to learn. One thing to note in particular is the flipped pedagology of a few of these classes. Although they have their benefits, the format of these classes just require more time invested in them than all of the other classes, and that's also assuming that we have an ideal case, where everything works perfectly the first time. Because that is never the case, we can also expect to spend an indefinte amount of time debugging programs/code, and looking for error messages. The ones that get to me the most are the ones that leave you sitting in front of your computer, on the brink of death at 3:00am and finding out that it was a simple syntax error and was not caught by the editor because your sense of pride makes you use a simple 'practical' editor like Vi/Vim instead of a text editor like Atom that could have solved the issue in a matter of seconds.
