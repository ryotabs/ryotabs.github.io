 # We've all been there.
 If I had a dollar for every time that someone asked a question in class that cound be answered by either looking at an announcement, schedule, course website, email, or the syllabus, then I'd probably have enough money for a few textbooks that I could purchase (which is probably the equivalent of like a million dollars or something like that) instead of "acquiring" a copy of it online. Although that analogy seems like hyperbole, there have been numerous times where someone asks something that can be found in another resource, and just wastes everyone's time by making the person that the question is asked to repeat themselves. In most cases, those types of questions are not typically answered by the person saying "look in the (insert reference material here)", as those types of responses come off as rude or mean in the generation of the "special snowflake". Although that may not be the case all the time, we can come to a general conclusion that people that ask questions without thinking and expect the one single answer to end all answers, and get very disappointed if they don't.
 
 # Help me help you
 From my limited experience, people don't understand that asking for help is a two way street. If you ask someone a half-assed question, then you'll probably get a half-assed answer. If it shows that someone is asking a question, and hasn't researched the issue to find a solution to the problem before asking, then how can they expect to have a detailed answer? Why should the person answering the question put more effort into answering the question than the person asking the question? Sometimes that may not even be the case. The person answering the question might not have the necessary information to answer the question sufficiently, like trying to make magic out of thin air. Although the people that you ask questions to seem like gurus, at the end of the day, they're just people just like you and I, and cannot perform miracles out of thin air. 
 
 # The programmer's greatest resource
 Stack Overflow has the reputation of being a place where people can show off their intellectual knowledge on a subject, sometimes in a very in-your-face and pretentious way. Despite this fact, we can't deny that Stack Overflow(and Stack Exchange as a whole) is one of the largest communities that is used by people from all professions and walks of life. Because of the size of the community, there are instances of "good" questions, and bad questions.
 
 [Here's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52192389/lambda-returning-itself-legal) an example (in my opinion) of a good question, as defined by the essay [How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). While I may not fully understand the exact syntax of the code in question, I have tried my best to identify the components of a good question. The title of the question itself has a good, short description of the issue. It has the issue, and separates the question of the issue. This allows people to view the questions intentions quickly, and have an understanding of what the question is asking from just the title. The question includes source code so we can see what the program does. The user then goes on and explains the different results from trying different things, and also includes an error message from one of the compilers. The top rated answer to the question provides a precise, simple answer up front, and then goes in depth explaining their reasoning/answer to the question, with reference to supporting/official documentation. 
 
 [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52233706/thought-on-my-implementations-of-push-pop-and-display-a-queue) could be an example of a question that is not the best to ask. The question is very open ended, and does not display a significant problem that needs to be addressed. It is just asking for someone to take their time to review all of the malfunctioning code, and expects an in depth review of their problem, and any other problems that come up, basically doing their work for them. 
 
 # The most important thing
The most important thing that I learned from this is that you get the amount that you put into it. Finding possible solutions to your questions through the vast amount of reasources on the internet, and exhausting all of your options before coming to someone with a question is one of the most valuable and helpful things that you can do, for any aspect of your career.
