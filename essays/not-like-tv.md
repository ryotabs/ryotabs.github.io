## So you want to be a software engineer

"So, what made you choose software engineering?" is a question that I often get from a lot of people that ask me about my career aspirations (newly made friends, girlfriend's parents, my own parents, etc), and they are often surprised by my answer. Unlike many of my peers, who have possibly had experiences in AP computer science in high school, or have already started building their own projects, or have been playing around with creating websites when they were still in elementary school, the HBO TV show Silicon Valley was one of the main reasons why I wanted to be a software engineer.

For those that haven't heard of it, it's a fictional TV show/parody that follows a young software engineer in the startup world of Silicon Valley who establishes one of the largest and fastest growing startups after creating his own revolutionary data compression system. Having a good compression system reduces the amount of resources needed to store data. As he goes on his journey, he encounters rival startups, venture capitalists, and has to deal with the almost cut-throat culture that surrounds Silicon Valley. The show was my first introduction into software engineering, as it contained a few accurate references/methods (like the SCRUM method)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVksFviJVE],
