## So you want to be a software engineer

I've had a lot of practice with how I could explain software engineering in a concise, but humourous way for the people that were curious about what software engineering entailed. I decided to pursue software engineering because I want to make my own rules and features to improve upon widely-used software products on today's market. There have been countless times where I'd encounter some kind of limitation of a computer program that I would be using, and wonder why it was not implemented. This would be followed by me screaming into the sky in hopes that the developers would add the feature in the next update of the program. However, after numerous frustrating discoveries of missing features and capabilities, I started thinking about the possiblity of creating those features myself.
