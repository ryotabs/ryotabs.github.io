## Maintaining your craft

Coding standards are something that I can compare to maintaining a vehicle. It's one of the things that seem completely negligible, but will eventually start to creep up on you, and will strike at the worst and most inconvenient moment, and will hit with full force. Having set coding standards will keep things neat and organized, and will definitely take some load off of the madness when you're occupied with debugging a program. Maintaining your program with clean code will benefit everyone involved, from the people that look at your code to look for errors, to your own self when you're eyebrows deep in the middle of debugging.

Incorporating ES Lint honestly wasn't really much of a learning process for me, as initial setup seemed like it had a "set it and forget it" kind of feel to it. All I need to do is to make sure it is enabled in the settings of the editor that I use to write code in, and include a configuration file with my code, and the rest is easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy. Whenever my code doesn't conform to the standard, errors appear, and hovering over the error with the mouse pointer lets you know what is wrong, and provides the relevant documentation. Also, there is a red icon in the upper right hand corner of the code editor that lets you know that you still have errors to correct. Once all errors are corrected, the red X icon will be replaced with a green checkmark that lets you know that all is well.

The green checkmark seems like an achievement of itself when you clean up all the ES Lint errors that appear as you write your code. When you first start with ES Lint, it seems like it'll make the time to write code much more longer as you need to take care of all of your ES Lint errors that appear, but picks up real quick once you get used to the standards that you are held to. In the span of a week, it feels like my time with some of these practice WODs during the week have substantially decreased, and I can say that I feel very comfortable with writing code that adheres to the standards of ES Lint. I'm looking forward to honing my code even further, and using ES Lint to achieve that gives me confidence that my code will be as clean as possible.
