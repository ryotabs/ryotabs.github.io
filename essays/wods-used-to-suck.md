## Is it supposed to feel this way?

My first time in the gym was extremely strange. I was just a skinny kid that wanted to work out and get muscles so people would stop picking on me and impress girls. I've tried all kinds of exercises and workouts that I've seen online, and they just felt strange to me. I would jump around from workout program to workout program, and didn't really stay consistent. I was talking to my friend one time and was wondering if it was normal to have feelings of confusion. I just assumed that I would pick up a pair of dummbells and a barbell and become Arnold. However, he quickly reassured me that things were not that easy. It was something new that I was doing, and what I was feeling was completely normal as it was something that I never done before. The most important thing was to stay consistent and trust the process, and everything will come with time. I still keep those words in my head to this day whenever I feel like I'm stuck in a plateu or am not making progress.

I guess learning Javascript is no different. 

## The Javascript Experience

As a complete newbie, learning Javascript was definitely a good experience coming from Java. I got to learn the small intricacies of the language, like the triple equals operator, and for-of/for-each loops. The initial experience felt like my first time in the gym. I was uncomfortable learning a new language, and the fact that we were already expected to write some Javascript for a few assignment didn't really make things any easier. However, the strucure of the module provided an effective way that allowed me to adapt and learn the language quickly. As I stayed consistent with my practice, I was able to get a lot more comfortable writing the language, just like my experience in the gym. With the extremely small experience that I have so far, I feel like Javascript is a pretty good language for software engineering as object manipulation seems a lot more simple compared to Java. However, I can see that this can lead to some confusion later on down the line, especially in large scale systems, but we'll strangle that beast when we get to it. 

## WODs used to suck

In a past life, I did some crossfit for a little bit, and have done a few WODs, which were one of the most painful phsycial experiences that I've ever put myself through. Doing those WODs left me physcially drained, and at one point, I thought they served no other pupose than to make me puke, so I was a little surprised when I heard the term WOD in the context of software engineering. I thought that I was in a world of hurt, and that the mental abuse was so bad that it would make me want to puke. However, as I went through the practice WODs, I felt like they did a good job at emulating the same feeling of an acutal, physical WOD, without all of the bad parts. Instead of physical pain, these WODs provided a lot of mental stimulation, and exercised the muscle of the mind. I feel like this approach is appropriate for software engineering as it provides the right mental stimulation that is needed, and also provides practice on the language so it gives us a lot of exposure to get comfortable with it. They also provide an opportunity to stay consistent, as there is a practice WOD nearly every day, that is either done at home, or in class, so the WODs will definitely have a positive impact on the learning process.
